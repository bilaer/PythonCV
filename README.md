# PythonCV
Computer Vision algorithms implementation in Python

## Finished algorithms implementation
* Convolution
* Smoothing
  * Gaussian Smoothing
  * Average Smoothing
* Threshold
 * Global Threshold
 * Otsu Threshold
* Image praymid
* Canny edge detection
* Hough line transfomation

## Ongoing algorithms implementation
* DoG keypoint detector
* Homography/Image stitching
* BRIEF descriptor
* Hough circle transform
* Watershed algorithms

## Libaries
* Use [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) to conduct matrix calculation
* Use [PIL](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to open, save and draw lines on the images
